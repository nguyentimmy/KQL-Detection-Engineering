## 🦠 AV Detections

**Defender antivirus detections weighted by remediation outcome.**

A detection isn't automatically a resolved detection. This panel separates threats that were actually cleaned from those that were detected but left in place.

- `NotRemediated` — detected but remediation failed, was allowed, or didn't complete
- `WasRunning` — the threat was executing at detection time
- `IsHighImpactFamily` — ransomware, backdoors, RATs, credential-theft tooling, loaders
- Execution from user-writable paths adds weight

**The row that matters:** a high-impact family that was **running** and **not remediated** is a live infection, not a caught one — that's the trigger to pivot into device triage.
