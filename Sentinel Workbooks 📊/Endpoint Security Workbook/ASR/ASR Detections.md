## 🛡️ ASR Detections

**Attack Surface Reduction rule blocks, ranked by rule impact.**

ASR is prevention rather than detection — a hit means something was stopped. The value is in *which* rule fired, since that indicates what the attacker was attempting.

- Severity assigned per rule rather than uniformly: ransomware, email-executable, Office-child-process, and vulnerable-driver blocks rank highest
- Injection, obfuscated-script, and untrusted-executable blocks rank medium
- Environment-specific noisy rules and known-good processes are excluded
